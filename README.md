Sass just makes it way easier for me to write cleaner css files. 
Also should help you avoid using css variables, which will help you get back into xsplit if you prefer.

## Files
- **base.scss** & **stylesheet.scss** ~ Our two stylesheets, to showcase *@import*
- **stylesheet_output.css** ~ The Sass generated file using *stylesheet.scss* and automatically pulling in the *@require*'d *base.scss*
- **generate_css.bat** ~ The most basic Sass command(s).

## Installation
- http://sass-lang.com/install
- Note that you need to install Ruby first.

## Usage
- http://sass-lang.com/guide
- You can write normal CSS if you like, but Sass has some cool extras too.
- Their guide is better than anything I'm writing here, but I put some comments in the scss files.

## Contact
- Feel free to contact me anywhere if you have questions or want to talk overlays or whatever else.
